Our holiday was arranged by my best man and sister Amy.

9 AM flight to Queenstown.

## Café Vue

The downside of our morning flight was missing out on departure lounge beer and chips.

The continental breakfast comes for two which I shared with my wife before we departed for our honeymoon.
The thick slices of good sourdough were toasted harshly but recovered under plenty of Lescure butter and Café Vue's own jam.
A couple of pastries followed which we enjoyed with orange juice and English Breakfast tea.

## Kai Whakapai

Lake Wanaka is predominant

Afternoon in time for happy hour.

The mainstay beers from Wanaka Beerworks are on tap.
The Brewski was my favourite, a floral pilsner that suited the cold yet sunny weather.
The Cardrona Gold was a sweeter Vienna.
Both were great with chips.
