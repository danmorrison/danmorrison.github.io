# [Altius Coffee Brewers](http://yelp.com/biz/altius-coffee-brewers-melbourne)

Altius Coffee Brewers is a bright little space with a bar and a few seats.

I enjoyed their black filter coffee which they made with beans roasted by Market Lane.

# [Kum Den](http://yelp.com/biz/kum-den-chinese-restaurant-melbourne)

Some colleagues from 2007 organised a reunion lunch at Kum Den.
I was the only person in our group who wasn't Chinese.
It reminded me of when I was the odd redhead eating at City BBQ in the 90s.

I haven't tired of snickering at the name Kum Den in over a decade.
Maybe I never will.

Vegetarian dishes were clearly labelled on their menu and they had a whole section for vegetarian appetisers.
The Chinese mushroom with Japanese bean curd on noodles was a delicious combination of mushrooms that everyone envied until they learned it was meat-free.

I drank the complimentary tea while people at a neighbouring table worked their way through the slab they had brought.

# [Swimwear Galore](http://yelp.com/biz/swimwear-galore-fitzroy)

Swimwear Galore had a range that was both wide and deep so I was able to find the style of bathers that I wanted (mens square leg) in a variety of colours.
Being ginger I also bought a matching long-sleeved rashguard.

Their changing room rules and attendants were a complication but I left happy and avoided sunburn in Hawaii.

# Panama 5

Cass and I went with Mark, Henry and Fiona to a travel-themed Yelp party at Panama Dining Room.

We drank very well, starting with a Paloma made with grapefruit juice and
Herradura
The Feral Sly Fox
Jansz sparkling

I chose a postcard from a wall in the hope of winning a classy magnum of Wirra Wirra but instead won a Yelp showbag.
It had more drink tokens, a Lord of the Fries voucher and the bag itself turned out to be really handy.
I've since travelled with it to Hawaii, Hobart and Sydney.

# Lord of the Fries 5

After the Yelp event Cass and I took our voucher for free chips to the nearest Lord of the Fries.

# Crown Village Cinemas Gold Class 2

We watched Interstellar which was big and long enough for Gold Class.
