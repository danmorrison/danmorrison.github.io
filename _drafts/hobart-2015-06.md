Following [Cass's birthday][] last year we went to Hobart for my thirty-first.
We were joined by Ellen, Chris, Suet, Keith and Lesley who came along for the third [Dark Mofo][] festival.

[Cass's birthday]

## [Travelodge Hobart](http://yelp.com/biz/travelodge-hobart-hobart)

Travelodge Hobart was right in the middle of everywhere we wanted to visit.
We also booked it at a great price.

Our room looked like it did on their website.
Sharing the bathroom required a bit of finesse but I'd happily stay again.

## [Salamanca Market](http://yelp.com/biz/salamanca-market-battery-point)

Our concierge gave us a map and immediately highlighted the route to Salamanca Market since that's where every visitor goes on Saturday.

It wound down and around Salamanca Place with many craft, food and drink stalls.
I ate a baked potato with vegan coleslaw, a recently fried felafel and a masala pie from Summer Kitchen Bakery.
Keith had Tasmania's famous scallop pie from Smith's Specialty Pies.

William McHenry & Sons Distillery from Port Arthur and Lark Distillery from around the corner were both there for World Gin Day.
We tasted McHenry's Classic London Dry Gin, Barrel Aged Gin and their excellent Navy Strength Gin.

## [Lark Distillery](http://yelp.com/biz/lark-distillery-hobart)

We were fortunate to be in Hobart for World Gin Day and to celebrate it at Lark Distillery.
They had several special cocktails featuring their own pepperberry-infused Forty Spotted Gin.
I had a Negroni, a Gin & Tonic which came with pepperberries and a gin-charged hot tea.
I also had their limited gin that had been aged in a pinot noir cask.

We shared a few of their ploughman's in their front room which easily accommodated the seven of us.

## [Mona Ferry](http://yelp.com/biz/mona-ferry-hobart)

On our second visit we travelled on MR-0, the smallest of the Mona ferries.
It was the opening night of Marina Abramović's Private Archaeology so there was a crowd but the information desk let us know which gate to loiter around.

Consequently we were the first to board and secured the circle of white seats in the middle of the floor.
We sat surrounded by gold-coloured bars and drank Moorilla sparkling riesling and Moo Brew Belgo.
It was a lovely cruise and again I wished it were longer.

## [Museum of Old and New Art](http://yelp.com/biz/museum-of-old-and-new-art-berriedale)

Even though we caught the first ferry to the opening night of Marina Abramović's Private Archaeology we still had a long queue outside.
We waited beside the brilliant white light of James Turrell's Amarna and David Walsh passed us while drinking from a bottle of champagne.

Inside we shared a Moorilla sparkling riesling then entered Private Archaeology.
I thought the initial rooms failed to capture the engagement and intensity of Marina's performance art save for the videos of Rest Energy and The Scream.
I much preferred the room of Transitory Objects with the glassy-eyed re-performers waiting to be noticed among the crowd of people trying to be present.
Confronting my apprehension I also experienced Counting the Rice where we wore lab coats and headphones then counted grains of rice and lentils for 10 minutes.

Following the exhibition we wandered the collection and revisited favourites like Greg Taylor's Cunts and Other Conversations, Brigita Ozolins's Kryptos, Meghan Boody’s Poison and Candice Breitz’s Queen (A Portrait of Madonna).

We then met outside and drank Moo Brew Harvest Ale from plastic cups beside unattended fires before our ferry back to Hobart.

## [Waterman's Beer Market](http://yelp.com/biz/watermans-beer-market-battery-point)

Waterman's Beer Market had an excellent range of beer.
Over several visits I drank the Captain Bligh's HIPA, Edge Cereal Killer, Red Island Quiet Deeds Lamington Ale, Morrison Irish Red Ale, Beer Here Nordic Rye, Little Rivers Pale Ale and my favourite beer of our trip the Kick Snare Ella Brown of Motown.

We returned for their inspired Corner Store which was six thickly-battered potato cakes with smoky tomato sauce.
We ordered three serves of these in a row.
I also liked their Not Nachos which swapped tortilla chips for hot chips.

Their bathroom featured one-way glass facing their beer garden.
Unfortunately it's a converstation starter.

## [Salamanca Bakehouse](http://yelp.com/biz/salamanca-bakehouse-hobart)

Salamanca Bakehouse was reliably open for us after the bars of Salamanca had closed their kitchens.
They're open 24 hours.

I was delighted to find a vegan curried vegetable pie on their menu and went back for seconds.
The pie had sold out on two of my three visits though, leaving me with a late-night dinner of plain bread rolls.

## [Farm Gate Market](http://yelp.com/biz/farm-gate-market-hobart)

Farm Gate Market had doubled in size since my last visit.
I began with a cup of vegetable broth then excitedly followed with an applecino which lived up to my fond memory.

For breakfast I had a vegan laska rich in coconut from the Laksa Kid then Pacha Mama Mexican's autumn vegan burrito with maple-roasted beetroot, pickled cabbage, chilli beans and cashew aioli.

## [Marina Abramović and David Walsh in Conversation](http://darkmofo.net.au/program/marina-abramovic/marina-abramovic-and-david-walsh-in-conversation)

https://vimeo.com/137203298

We all managed to attend Marina Abramović and David Walsh in Conversation at the Odeon Theatre despite the tickets selling out in minutes.
The theatre was lit entirely in the dark red of Dark Mofo.

David opened with a clumsy question about urination but I appreciated their effort to keep the conversation practical rather than reverential.
Several of David's jokes failed to land and when topics like shamanism and telepathy made them uncomfortable they tried to deflect with a desperate humour.
Combined with their large head, grey beard and glasses I was amazed how closely they resembled my father.

I found Marina impressive.
I had to listen actively to compensate for their Serbian accent and they frequently employed dramatic silences

Unfortunately the audience was then invited to ask questions.
Someone asked Marina how hesychasm had influenced their work then, rather than explain the concept, spelled out H-E-S-Y-C-H-A-S-M seven times.
As we endured these spellings I thought what David soon said: "it evidently hasn't influenced Marina's work".
But Marina persevered, chiding David "you give up too easily", and extracted a question worth answering.

I've since repeated this phrase to myself many times (in her accent of course).
