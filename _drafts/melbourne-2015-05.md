5th Good Beer Week

## [Wine House](http://yelp.com/biz/wine-house-southbank-2)

I passed Wine House for years before finally going inside.
The stuffy facade of the old and rare wines collector house had concealed their welcoming staff and lively range of wines.

I picked up a tempranillo and a sangiovese by Fighting Gully Road.
As it was Friday I also got to taste riesling, shiraz and cabernet from Best's Great Western.
From my previous visit I loved the Syrahmi Demi syrah which they had recommended as a weekday wine for under $20.

I wish they had any other name though.
They've been trading under the name since the year Amy released her first album but every visit reminds me of her.

## [Mister Nice Guy's BakeShop](http://yelp.com/biz/mister-nice-guy-bakery-ascot-vale)

Everything in Mister Nice Guy's BakeShop is vegan.
They have plenty of cakes and cupcakes as well as bagels and coffee.

For breakfast we shared a BLT (the B is for facon) and a curried egg (tofu) salad bagel.
Their mayonnaise and cheese were both made in-house.
Cass had an almond latte and I had an iced coffee made with hazelnut milk.

We followed with chocolate babka and a Rockin' Roller cupcake (strawberry-iced chocolate).

We took their sausage rolls home for dinner.
These tasted like they were made from refried beans and were wrapped in excellent pastry.
