In 2016 I achieved a goal I'd held for many years and began to formally study German.

​​The [textbook][] (`das Kursbuch`) and [workbook][] (`das Arbeitsbuch`) for this course were Menschen A1.

[textbook]: https://shop.hueber.de/de/menschen-a1-kb-mit-dvd-rom.html
[workbook]: https://shop.hueber.de/de/menschen-a1-ab-mit-2-audio-cds.html

## Klasse 1 mit Peggy Hecker 2016-01-30

We began with lesson 1 (`Lektion 1`) on textbook pages 11 and 12 (`Kursbuch Seiten 11 und 12` or `Kb S 11-12`).
Peggy apologised for the catchiness of the song then played `Wo wohnt Winfried` for task (`Aufgabe`) 1 which was to name all the cities where Winfried might be staying such as Freiburg, Zürich or Köln.

`Aufgabe 2` introduced introductions: `Hallo! Ich heiße Paco. Und wer bist du?`

`Aufgabe 3` involved both asking where do you come from (`Woher kommst du?`) and learning how to conjugate (`konjugate`) verbs:

```
Ich komme
Du kommst
Sie kommen
Er/sie kommt
```

`Aufgabe 5` let us practise listening to people converse and introduced the formal pronoun `Sie`.

At 10:30 AM we broke for sparkling wine and potato chips.
Peggy insisted this was a German thing to do and I didn't question her.

After our break we learned the alphabet.
I had seen the alphabet in the `Kursbuch` before attending the class and had questioned whether I should be starting at a higher level.
Surprisingly this was the hardest part of class 1.

The only letters that were pronounced familiarly were F, L, M, N and S.
E and I both sounded like E to me and Y had three syllables.
The others all had variations that took me the rest of the week to learn by singing [a children's song][].

[a children's song]: https://youtube.com/watch?v=uxSslcaYFRk

```
Fertig ist mein Alphabet
Hör doch nur wie leicht das geht
```

Next we found partners and wrote a simple dialogue:

```
Frank: Guten tag.
Dan:   Guten tag. Wie heißen Sie?
Frank: Ich heiße Frank. Und Sie?
Dan:   Ich heiße Dan.
Frank: Lass uns "du" sagen.
Dan:   Ja. Und woher kommst du?
Frank: Ich komme aus Australien. Und du?
Dan:   Ich auch. Wunderbar.
Frank: Tschüs.
Dan:   Tschüs.
```

It wasn't until after class that I realised I could have asked Frank if `er kommt aus Frankreich`.

## Klasse 2 mit Peggy Hecker 2016-02-06

Finishing `Lektion 1` we began `Klasse 2` by skipping to `Kb S 141 und 143`.
My partner Andrew and I stepped through a list of people including Merkel, Mozart and Goethe asking who is that (`Wer ist das?`) and where do they come from (`Und woher kommt er/sie?`).
`Angela Merkel kommt aus Deutschland.`

Then we moved to `Lektion 2 Aufgabe 1`.
We listened to four people introduce themselves and matched them with their business cards.
Their professions were `Journalistin`, `Architekt`, `IT-Spezialist` and `Marketing-Managerin`.
The suffix `-in` is used for females.

`Aufgabe 2` introduced how to say your profession (`der Beruf`), what you work as and where you work:

```
Ich bin Software-Ingenieur.
Ich arbeite als IT-Berater.
Ich arbeite bei PwC.
```

`Aufgabe 3` introduced how to say your marital status (`der Familienstand`):

```
Ich bin verheiratet.
Ich habe keine Kinder.
Ich lebe in Brunswick West mit mein Frau.
```

`Aufgabe 4` involved learning how to count from 0 (`null`) to 100 (`einhundert`).
We used this to then ask each other how old are you (`Wie alt bist du?`):

```
Ich bin einunddreißig Jahre alt.
```

Peggy transitioned between questions by saying `Dann` (then) which I kept hearing as my name.
Maybe Dain, Diane and Doan felt the same way.
She also asked questions by throwing her soft toy pig Schweini to the person being asked.
When she accidentally hit Charlotte with Schweini we learned how to say "excuse me" (`entschuldigung`) and "I'm sorry" (`es tut mir leid`).

We finished by finding partners, interviewing each other in German then introducing each other to the class:

```
Das ist Charlotte.
Sie ist einundzwanzig Jahre alt.
Sie ist Studentin bei Monash.
Sie lebt mit ihr Mutter, Bruder, Schwester and ihren Hund Agatha in Mentone.
```

## Klasse 3 mit Peggy Hecker 2016-02-13

`Klasse 3` began with a game of bingo.
We each filled two grids with numbers from `eins` to `fünfzig`.
I chose numbers that were harder to learn such as `elf`, `zwölf` and `siebzehn` and was the first to call bingo.

Then we learned how to ask for someone's phone number (`Wie ist deine Telefonnummer?`).
Peggy played a series of dialogues where people exchanged their numbers but we all had to listen several times before we could successfully write them down.

Next we formed groups and wrote introductions for some cartoon characters.
I wrote a story about Christoph (named after but in no way based upon [Schneider][]):

[Schneider]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Schneider

```
Das ist Christoph.
Er lebt in Köln und komme aus Heidelberg.
Seine Muttersprache ist Deutsch.
Er ist Sammler von Beruf.
Er ist vierundfünfzig Jahre alt.
Er spricht Deutsch und Englisch.
```

Then we moved to `Lektion 3 Aufgabe 1`.
We listened to Herbert lie about his wife (`die Frau`) and learned how to refer to family members (`das Familienmitglieder`).
This continued with `Aufgaben 2 und 3`.

`Aufgabe 4` introduced [V2 word order][].
Peggy stressed that this was the most important thing we had learned and that it would be essential to our progression.
I found its formalism pleasant.

[V2 word order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order

Days later Cass told me that I was speaking English differently.
I think the biggest change was learning V2 word order.
In my youth I had resisted learning a second language for imperial reasons and it took only three weeks of classes to unseat English as my natural language.

`Aufgabe 4` introduced the wonderful word `doch`.
It addresses the problem that is caused when a question is asked with a negative assumption:

```
Roy:     Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
Deckard: Yes.
Roy:     Huh?
```

With a negative English question such as "Is it not?" you can reply either "no" to agree or "yes" to confuse everyone.
The language isn't equipped for the double negative.
This problem reminded me of [Kernighan and Pike's][] advice that "Functions that return a boolean (true or false) value should be named so that the return value is unambiguous."
`Doch` offers a third alternative to "yes" or "no", comparable to the Australian "yeah, nah".

[Kernighan and Pike's]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming

Then we practised syntax by writing sentences on strips of paper, slicing them into individual words then exchanging them with others to reconstruct.

We finished with `Aufgabe 8` by finding partners, interviewing each other in German then introducing each other's `Familienmitglieder` to the class.
My partner Phil had a sprawling family tree which took me a while to elicit:

```
Phil hast vier Bruder und eine Schwester.
Bruder Daniel hat drei Kinder und ein Enkel.
Alex hat eine Tochter.
Nicholas arbeitet als Verkäufer und hat drei Kinder.
Chris arbeitet als Soldart und hat zwei Kinder.
Katrina arbeitet als Artztin und hat keine Kinder.
```

## Klasse 4 mit Eva Spiesberger 2016-02-20

Our fourth class brought a new teacher Eva from Austria (`Österreich`).
She was softer spoken than Peggy, adept with the digital whiteboard and rarely referred to our `Kursbuch`.

We began with dialogue that was a bit faster than we were used to.
We shook hands with each other while alternating between `Freut mich` and `Angenehm`.
We also added `Was machst du hier?` to our introductions (`Ich lerne Deutsch und drinke Kaffee, und du?`).

Then we practised numbers greater than 100 by listening to an auction.
Occasionally I confused `Zwei` und `Drei` but mostly I found this easy.

Eva had brought supermarket catalogues back from Europe and we practised asking each other the price (`Preise`) of various items.
As an Australian the prices looked like they were from the 90s.
It was shocking how expensive things are here.

```
Was kostet das?
Was kosten die?
Wie viel kostet das?
Wie viel kosten die?
```

Next we learned definitive articles (`definiter Artikel`) and the names of common objects.
I enjoyed learning that a couch could be both neuter (`das Sofa`) and feminine (`die Couch`).
Even better though was seeing Michaël exclaim "No way!" when he learned that tables (`Tische`) were masculine in German unlike in French.

To learn the names of some common objects we each drew three objects that we use frequently then looked them up in a German-English dictionary.
I drew a coffee machine (`die Kaffeemaschine`), wallet (`die Brieftasche`) and pencil (`der Bleistift`) because Charlotte had already claimed laptop (`der Laptop`).
I was surprised to learn how difficult I found using a paper dictionary and hope to not use one again.

Eva explained that the gender of compound words was determined by the last word, so coffee machine (`der Kaffee` + `die Maschine`) becomes the feminine coffeemachine (`die Kaffeemaschine`).

We ended by learning farewells.
Apparently `Schönes Wochenende` means "Have a nice weekend" despite how much it sounds like English swearing.
A polite way to reply is `Danke, gleichfalls` ("Thanks, same to you").

## Klasse 5 mit Eva Spiesberger 2016-02-27

`Klasse 5` began with sentence structure (`die Satzkonstruktion`).
Eva reiterated the V2 word order then introduced a new rule that the subject of a sentence comes immediately before or after the verb.
To help everyone remember this she drew a heart between the subject and verb of various sentences.

To practise this we formed sentences using five `Frageworts`, seven verbs and seven objects.
I was able to make 19 different combinations that made sense and conjugated correctly, eg:

```
Wie hießt du?
Woher kommet ihr
```

Then we learned the nominative definite, indefinite and negative articles that precede nouns:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Nominativ</th>
		<th>definiter Artikel</th>
		<th>indefiniter Artikel</th>
		<th>Negativartikel</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>maskulin</td>
		<td>der</td>
		<td>ein</td>
		<td>kein</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>neutral</td>
		<td>das</td>
		<td>ein</td>
		<td>kein</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>feminin</td>
		<td>die</td>
		<td>eine</td>
		<td>keine</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>plural</td>
		<td>die</td>
		<td>—</td>
		<td>keine</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Next we learned colours using [Connector Pens][].

[Connector Pens]: http://faber-castell.com.au/55713/Products/Playing-Learning/Products/Connector-Pens/splrn_index1.aspx

We finished with pronunciation.
Eva tested our ability to discern between word pairs like `den` and `denn`, `bitten` and `bieten`, `leben` and `lieben` and even `Masse` and `Maße`.
We listened along while playing connect the dots, drawing a house and a fish.

## Klasse 6 mit Eva Spiesberger 2016-03-05

`Klasse 6` began with us laying words on a table like dominoes.
They connected to form sentences but could only be validly combined a finite number of ways.
This tested our understanding of articles.

Then we found partners and practised questions and negations:

```
Dan: Ist das eine Geldbörse?
Andrew: Das ist keine Gelbörse. Das ist eine Tasche.
```

Then we practiced conjugation using a list of words and rolling a dice to choose from six nominative pronouns `ich`, `du`, `er/sie`, `wir`, `ihr` and `Sie`.

Next we learned the cardinal directions (`die Himmelsrichtung`, literally "sky directions"):

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Nordwesten</td>
		<td>Norden</td>
		<td>Nordosten</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Westen</td>
		<td>☼</td>
		<td>Osten</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Südwesten</td>
		<td>Süden</td>
		<td>Sudosten</td>
	</tr>
</table>

We used these directions to locate places relatively: `Melbourne ist im Süden von Australien` and `Sydney ist Nördlich von Melbourne`.
We then tested this ability by finding partners and helping each other find cities on a map of Germany.

We finished with `Wo wohnt Winfried` from `Klasse 1`.

## Klasse 7 mit Eva Spiesberger 2016-03-12

Eva warned us that `Klasse 7` would be challenging.
We learned the `Akkusativ` case which is used for the objects of sentences (which I could only remember by thinking about [RDF][]).

[RDF]: https://w3.org/RDF

Eva introduced the `Akkusativ` by showing that these two sentences are equivalent:

```
Der Mann kauft einen Hund.

Einen Hund kauft der Mann.
```

In both sentences the subject is `Der Mann` and the object is `der Hund`, identified by the `Akkusativ indefinite ‚einen‘`.
As long as V2 word order is adhered to the order of subject and object is not important.

The `Akkusativ` definite, indefinite and negative articles are:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Akkusativ</th>
		<th>definiter Artikel</th>
		<th>indefiniter Artikel</th>
		<th>Negativartikel</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>maskulin</td>
		<td>den</td>
		<td>einen</td>
		<td>keinen</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>neutral</td>
		<td>das</td>
		<td>ein</td>
		<td>kein</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>feminin</td>
		<td>die</td>
		<td>eine</td>
		<td>keine</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>plural</td>
		<td>die</td>
		<td>—</td>
		<td>keine</td>
	</tr>
</table>

We practised using these articles by reading a sad story about a man who bought a dog to cheer up his lonely son then consequently became lonely himself.
Then we added the correct articles to a summary of Hamlet:

```
Der König hat einen Bruder. Er liebt den Bruder aber den
Bruder liebt den König nicht. Der König hat auch einen Sohn.
Der Sohn heißt Hamlet. Der Bruder ermordet den König und
heiratet seine Frau. Aber den König kommt als Geist zurück.
Hamlet, den Sohn, und sein Freund sehen den Geist. Den
Geist sagt zu Hamlet „Dein Onkel ist der Mörder!“ Am Ende
ermordet Hamlet seinen Onkel. So ist es.
```

Next we read sentences and identified which articles were `bestimmt oder unbestimmt` and which were `Nominativ oder Akkusativ`.

Eva then further demonstrated the flexibility of word order by assigning us words on cards then having us stand in the various orders that are valid.
The cards were:

```
Die Schüler
lernen
heute
den Akkusativ
mit Eva
in Raum 5
.
```

Then we learned the conjugations of `haben`.
This was one of the earliest German words I had learned thanks to `Du Hast`.
Back in those high school days I knew that `hast` sounded similar to `hasst` but had no idea about verb conjugation.
It was nice to reflect on the progress that I had made.

Next we played a puzzle that involved figuring out someone's family tree based on nine statements about their family.
This was great fun and felt like it engaged a lot of my mind.

We finished with a memory game.
In groups of four we took turns saying variations of `Ich reise nach Berlin und ich packe meinen Laptop` followed by what everyone preceding had packed.
`Er packt sien Handy, sie packt ihren Bleistift,` etc.

## Klasse 8 mit Eva Spiesberger 2016-03-19

We began `Klasse 8` by sharing our hobbies.
Mine were `laufen` and `Musik hören`.

Eva taught us the word `Fussball` and I questioned her as I had learned it as `Fußball`.
I later found out that as an Austrian she was unknowingly teaching us the `Österreichisches Deutsch` spelling rather than `Hochdeutsche`.

Then we learned `trennbare Verben` (separable verbs).
These verbs have a prefix that can be separated and moved to the end of the sentence.
For example, `einkaufen` has the prefix `ein` and verb `kaufen` which in a sentence becomes `Ich kaufe heute ein.`

Next we found verbs in cartoons of people in their `Freizeit` (free time).

Then we learned irregular modal verbs:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>müssen</th>
		<th>können</th>
		<th>dürfen</th>
		<th>wollen</th>
		<th>sollen</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ich</td>
		<td>muss</td>
		<td>kann</td>
		<td>darf</th>
		<td>will</th>
		<td>soll</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>du</td>
		<td>musst</th>
		<td>kannst</th>
		<td>darfst</th>
		<td>willst</td>
		<td>sollst</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>er/sie/es</td>
		<td>muss</th>
		<td>kann</th>
		<td>darf</th>
		<td>will</td>
		<td>soll</td>
	</tr>
</table>

We practiced making sentences with these:

```
Könnt ihr Fußball spielen?
Natürlich kann ich Fußball spielen.
```

Then we translated signs into sentences ranging from `Hier soll man leise sein` to `Hier muss man nach links abbiegen`.

We finished by drawing things that we like and have to do then asking each other what they are:

```
Andrew: Was willst du jeden Tag machen?
Dan:    Ich will jeden Tag mit meiner Katze spielen.
```
