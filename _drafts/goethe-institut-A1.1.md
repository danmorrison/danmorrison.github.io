In 2016 I achieved a goal I'd held for many years and began to formally study German.

​​The [textbook][] (`Kursbuch`) and [workbook][] (`Arbeitsbuch`) for this course were Menschen A1.

## Klasse 1 mit Peggy Hecker 2016-01-30

We began with lesson 1 (`Lektion 1`) on textbook pages 11 and 12 (`Kursbuch Seiten 11 und 12` or `Kb S 11-12`).
Peggy apologised for the catchiness of the song then played `Wo wohnt Winfried` for task (`Aufgabe`) 1 which was to name all the cities where Winfried might be staying such as Freiburg, Zürich or Köln.

`Aufgabe 2` introduced introductions: `Hallo! Ich heiße Paco. Und wer bist du?`

`Aufgabe 3` involved both asking where do you come from (`Woher kommst du?`) and learning how to conjugate (`konjugate`) verbs:

```
Ich komme
Du kommst
Sie kommen
Er/sie kommt
```

`Aufgabe 5` let us practise listening to people converse and introduced the formal pronoun `Sie`.

At 10:30 AM we broke for sparkling wine and potato chips.
Peggy insisted this was a German thing to do and I didn't question her.

After our break we learned the alphabet.
I had seen the alphabet in the `Kursbuch` before attending the class and had questioned whether I should be starting at a higher level.
Surprisingly this was the hardest part of class 1.

The only letters that were pronounced familiarly were F, L, M, N and S.
E and I both sounded like E to me and Y had three syllables.
The others all had variations that took me the rest of the week to learn by singing [a children's song][].

```
Fertig ist mein Alphabet
Hör doch nur wie leicht das geht
```

Next we found partners and wrote a simple dialogue:

```
Frank: Guten tag.
Dan:   Guten tag. Wie heißen Sie?
Frank: Ich heiße Frank. Und Sie?
Dan:   Ich heiße Dan.
Frank: Lass und "dei" sagen.
Dan:   Ja. Und woher kommst du?
Frank: Ich komme aus Australien. Und du?
Dan:   Ich auch. Wunderbar.
Frank: Tschüs.
Dan:   Tschüs.
```

It wasn't until after class that I realised I could have asked Frank if `er kommt aus Frankreich`.
