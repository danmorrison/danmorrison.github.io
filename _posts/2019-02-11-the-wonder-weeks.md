[Hetty van de Rijt and Frans Plooij][]:

> It is good to know that for adults, thinking and reasoning or logic are not the highest attainable goals, as some people like to think.
> Logic belongs in the world of programs and is subordinate to the worlds of principles and systems.
> If you really want to make a change, you will have to change your principles, and in order to change your principles, you will first have to change the accompanying system.
