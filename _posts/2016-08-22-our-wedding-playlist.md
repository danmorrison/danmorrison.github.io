![Congratulations from the Beaufort](congrats-cass-and-dan.jpeg)

​The hardest part of planning our wedding was choosing music.
I knew that I wanted [the Beaufort][] to play songs from my iPad in a random order but choosing songs that could create our intended vibe took hours.

[the Beaufort]: http://www.thebeaufort.com.au

I didn't intend for the first song to be included and my iPad wasn't initially set to random.
Otherwise this plan worked out great.

When I later looked through the songs that had played I found five gaps (which I've left as question marks).
I know [Bad Romance][] was in one of them but I don't know which.

[Bad Romance]: https://itunes.apple.com/album/id903213354?i=903213375

You can listen to this [shared playlist][] with Apple Music.
