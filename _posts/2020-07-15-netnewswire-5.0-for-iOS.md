I'm happy to have contributed to [NetNewsWire 5.0 for iOS][].

[NetNewsWire 5.0 for iOS]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210

The original developer Brent Simmons describes it as "[like podcasts, but for reading.]"
I use it to subscribe to news and blogs and read it every day.

Brent open-sourced the development of 5.0 and it is exceptionally high quality.
I joined their TestFlight as a beta tester and their Slack to follow the development.

My contribution was [small][], correcting the Auto Layout logic to align the labels when users add a new web feed.
But Maurice Parker merged my pull request and Brent closed my issue and now it has tens of thousands of users.
Iâ€™m happy with that.
