I subscribe to the Victorian Government's [Public Holidays][] calendar and North Melbourne Football Club's [fixture][].

[Public Holidays]: https://www.vic.gov.au/ical/holidays.html
[fixture]: https://my.ecal.com/northmelbourne

On iOS you can subscribe to a calendar published on the web in iCalendar format with suffix ".ics" by tapping a link to it.
If the calendar is instead published as an attachment you can add it manually:

1. Copy the calendar location.
2. Open the `Settings` app.
3. Tap `Mail, Contacts, Calendars`.
4. Tap `Add Account`.
5. Tap `Other`.
6. Tap `Add Subscribed Calendar`.
7. Paste the calendar location into the `Server` text field.
8. Modify the `Description` if desired.
9. Tap `Save`.

Adding the calendar subscription to iCloud unfortunately requires using OS X.
On OS X you can add it by:

1. Copy the calendar location.
2. Open the `Calendar` app.
3. Click `File` then `New Calendar Subscription â€¦`
4. Paste the calendar location into the `Calendar URL` text field.
5. Click `Subscribe`.
6. Modify the calendar `Name` and `Colour` if desired.
7. Ensure the `Location` is set to `iCloud`.
8. Click OK.
