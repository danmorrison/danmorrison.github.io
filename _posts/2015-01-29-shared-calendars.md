You can subscribe to shared calendars with iOS.

I subscribe to the Victorian Government's [Public Holidays][] calendar.

[Public Holidays]: http://www.vic.gov.au/ical/holidays.html

You can subscribe to a calendar published on the web in iCalendar format with suffix ".ics" by tapping a link to it.
If the calendar is instead published as an attachment you can add it manually:

1. Copy the calendar location.
2. Open the `Settings` app.
3. Tap `Mail, Contacts, Calendars`.
4. Tap `Add Account`.
5. Tap `Other`.
6. Tap `Add Subscribed Calendar`.
7. Paste the calendar location into the `Server` text field.
8. Modify the `Description` if necessary.
9. Tap `Save`.
