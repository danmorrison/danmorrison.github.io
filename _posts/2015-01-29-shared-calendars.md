I subscribe to the Victorian Government's [Public Holidays][] calendar and North Melbourne Football Club's [fixture][].

[Public Holidays]: https://www.vic.gov.au/ical/holidays.html
[fixture]: https://my.ecal.com/northmelbourne

On iOS you can subscribe to a calendar published on the web in iCalendar format with suffix ".ics" by tapping a link to it.
If the calendar is instead published as an attachment you can add it manually:

1. Copy the calendar location.
1. Open the `Settings` app.
1. Tap `Mail, Contacts, Calendars`.
1. Tap `Add Account`.
1. Tap `Other`.
1. Tap `Add Subscribed Calendar`.
1. Paste the calendar location into the `Server` text field.
1. Modify the `Description` if desired.
1. Tap `Save`.

Adding the calendar subscription to iCloud unfortunately requires using OS X.
On OS X you can add it by:

1. Copy the calendar location.
1. Open the `Calendar` app.
1. Click `File` then `New Calendar Subscription â€¦`
1. Paste the calendar location into the `Calendar URL` text field.
1. Click `Subscribe`.
1. Modify the calendar `Name` and `Colour` if desired.
1. Ensure the `Location` is set to `iCloud`.
1. Click OK.
