â€‹I've found Requiem Metal Podcast in the search results of many iTunes searches.
The hosts Mark and Jason have covered many bands that I love and spoken about them with experience.

Some of my favourite episodes have been their best-ofs that covered each year from 2008 to 2012.

In episode 178 they introduced 10 songs that they've been listening to over the last few years.
They played 10 different songs though.

Fortunately I found some great new recommendations in both lists.
