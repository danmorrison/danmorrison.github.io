The first time I saw [Tropfest][] was in 2007.
I watched it from home and was intrigued by the festival format.
[Road Rage][] and [Between the Flags][] told nice stories with empathy yet it was [Fore!][] that I found the most memorable.

The following year Cass, Justin, Shantelle, Lesley and I went to our first live screening at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl.
I loved the premise of [Mouse Race][] and often remember the compulsive frying of onions in [Looped][].
I think I was the only one of us who preferred the winning film [Marry Me][] though.
The idea of changing to impress someone was problematic but i found the film earnest.

We met back up in 2009 with a picnic and drinks.
I over-prepared for this one and had to leave the wine glasses and bread knife that I had brought with security.
I enjoyed the lively low-budget documentary [The Furry Cheque Book][].
[Gyton Grantley][] was in both the tense [Beyond Words][] and what Justin and I felt was the year's winner [Being Carl Williams][].

In 2010 the Melbourne screening moved from the grassy Sidney Myer Music Bowl to the bricks of Federation Square.
[Every Second Weekend][] shared unvoiced stories and I found the details of [Happenstance][] beautiful.
I wished the prize would go to [My Neighbourhood Has Been Overrun by Baboons][] but even more I wished we'd be back at the Bowl next year.

Since Federation Square was selected again for 2011 Cass, Justin, Shantelle and I drove to Sydney to see it live at the Domain.
We stayed at The Rocks and spent all day at the Domain.
I liked [A Desperate Deed][] and cried over [Things To Do][] but joined everyone in cheering for the winning [Animal Beatbox][].
It was great to see Tropfest at its home.

In 2012 Tropfest returned to the Bowl and so did we.
The winning film [Lemonade Stand][] was well received by all of us.
[Eva Lazarro][] was both in the lovely [Jack and Lily][] and wrote and directed my favourite [Alice's Baby][].

There were two Tropfest Australias in 2013.
The first was in February and had [Ca$h Cow][], a film about a character from Sunrise.
I thought [Cargo][] and [Time][] were beautiful stories about a dad and a son told through horror and science fiction.

For the second in December Cass and I made a home visit to Justin and Shantelle who was pregnant with their child Alice.
I found [Sine][] and [Coping][] captivating but my favourite was the delightful [Off the Meter][].

I love that we've shared these experiences over the years.
We all missed Tropfest Australia 2014 though.
For the first time in seven years I didn't know it was on.

I subscribed to the [Tropfest Australia web feed][] years ago and have followed its news  in anticipation of each event.
I'm still subscribed but it has been decommissioned.
The last update was on 2014-10-10.

[Tropfest Australia web feed]: http://tropfest.com/au/feed

Since that last update the Tropfest International website was redesigned without web feeds by [Lash Creative][].
I don't know whether feeds were deliberately omitted or simply forgotten but they were removed without even a final post declaring their closure.
Instead of being given a chance to subscribe to their mailing list we all missed out on seeing Tropfest.

[Lash Creative]: http://lashcreative.com.au

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Spotify are centralised services that cannot substitute for a web feed.
They are fads that will continually be replaced with new fancies.
I think it's a shame that people require their fans to use them.
