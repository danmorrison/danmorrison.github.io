title:  "Be subjective"

GamerGate began in August 2014.
The trend was named by [Adam Baldwin][] (whose work I've accordingly blacklisted).
I see it as embodying two things:

1. Misogyny.
2. A plea for ethics in journalism.

The misogyny has been pervasive and has unfortunately reinforced my bias against people who identify as gamers.
It has also given me even more respect for the women involved such as [Zoe Quinn][], [Anita Sarkeesian][] and [Brianna Wu][].

The plea for ethics has been a distant second.
The central argument is that journalists should be objective.
I think this argument is absurd, mired in materialism and based on the assumption that criticism or review could possibly occur independently of opinion or bias.

I consider myself to be deeply biased.
I believe in equality and support feminism, socialism and vegetarianism.
I want you to believe in these things too.

So, from this hateful trend I have taken a principle for writing:

> Be subjective.

I first realised the need for this principle when my wife Cass read my first Yelp reviews and told me "they don't sound like you."
By trying to selflessly communicate my experiences to imagined readers I had ended up sounding more like [real people][] than a real person.
I believe writing subjectively is more honest and hopefully also more interesting.

I think Albert Einstein was a great practitioner of the subjective approach and that his magnificent essay [Why Socialism?][] exemplifies this.
He of all people could have employed the [appeal to authority][] in any matter.
Instead he defined what he perceived to be an essential problem, offered an ideal as a solution, illustrated how it may be more attractive than the status quo, how indeed it may be inevitable, then how we are each capable of achieving the necessary change.

Einstein was vegetarian too.
