26 January 2014 was an Australian national holiday.
Cass and I went to Brunswick Baths for CX Worx and BodyPump, I had a fried cauliflower sandwich and a longneck of Coopers Sparkling Ale at Wide Open Road then we listened to Triple J's Hottest 100.
Listening to (streamed) radio was a novelty but it is not a day I celebrate.

It was the anniversary of the First Fleet's arrival at Sydney Harbour in 1788.
On that day a British flag was planted in foreign land, establishing a colony with five ships of employed travellers and six ships of convicts.

The first time I heard this day called anything other than Australia Day was when [Morgan Junor][] referred to it as Invasion Day.
The name alone undermined what I had been taught.
*Of course* it was abhorrent to celebrate a country on the day that its original inhabitants were invaded.

Why didn't I figure this out for myself?
The easy answer is the naivety of youth.
The real answer more likely involves my upbringing among monarchists, reading nationalist news and attending a school where I was taught to sing [The Chinese ABC][].
Regardless of the reason I'm grateful to have since learned my error.

Defining the nation's day by the anniversary of the country's invasion institutionalises racism.
It was racism that allowed indigenous-occupied Australia to be colonised on the premise of *terra nullius* (land belonging to no-one).
Celebrating this event perpetuates racism and inequality.
