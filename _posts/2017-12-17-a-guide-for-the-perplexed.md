[Werner Herzog][]:

- <mark>Always take the initiative.</mark>
- There is nothing wrong with spending a night in jail if it means getting the shot you need.
- <mark>Send out all your dogs and one might return with prey.</mark>
- Never wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private and brief.
- <mark>Learn to live with your mistakes.</mark>
- <mark>Expand your knowledge and understanding of music and literature, old and modern.</mark>
- That roll of unexposed celluloid you have in your hand might be the last in existence, so do something impressive with it.
- There is never an excuse not to finish a film.
- Carry bolt cutters everywhere.
- <mark>Thwart institutional cowardice.</mark>
- <mark>Ask for forgiveness, not permission.</mark>
- <mark>Take your fate into your own hands.</mark>
- Learn to read the inner essence of a landscape.
- Ignite the fire within and explore unknown territory.
- <mark>Walk straight ahead, never detour.</mark>
- Manoeuvre and mislead, but always deliver.
- <mark>Donâ€™t be fearful of rejection.</mark>
- Develop your own voice.
- Day one is the point of no return.
- A badge of honor is to fail a film theory class.
- Chance is the lifeblood of cinema.
- Guerrilla tactics are best.
- Take revenge if need be.
- Get used to the bear behind you.
