[Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari][]:

> The Turing Test was invented in 1950 by the British mathematician Alan Turing, one of the fathers of the computer age.
> Turing was also a gay man in a period when homosexuality was illegal in Britain.
> In 1952 he was convicted of committing homosexual acts and forced to undergo chemical castration.
> Two years later he committed suicide.
> The Turing Test is simply a replication of a mundane test every gay man had to undergo in 1950s Britain: can you pass for a straight man?
> Turing knew from personal experience that it didn’t matter who you really were - it mattered only what others thought about you.
> According to Turing, in the future computers would be just like gay men in the 1950s.
> It won’t matter whether computers will actually be conscious or not.
> It will matter only what people think about it.
