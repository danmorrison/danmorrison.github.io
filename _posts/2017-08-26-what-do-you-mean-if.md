[Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang][]:

> There's a joke that I once heard a comedienne tell.
> It goes like this: "I'm not sure if I'm ready to have children.
> I asked a friend of mine who has children, <mark>"Suppose I do have kids.
> What if when they grow up, they blame me for everything that's wrong with their lives?"
> She laughed and said, "What do you mean, if?""</mark>
