On 8 July 2016 the Dallas Police Department used a bomb disposal robot to kill murder suspect Micah X Johnson.

For years robots have been used by police departments for surveillance and investigating suspect bombs.
Now they've been used for lethal force.

Using robots to serve the public trust, protect the innocent and uphold the law has been a dream of mine since I first saw [RoboCop][].
The film gave me a lifelong admiration of law and the idea that it could one day be enforced with the impartiality of machines.

I find it sad that lethal force was deemed necessary in this instance.
I am however hopeful that automation and robotics will reduce crime and disorder in my lifetime and beyond.
