## [Ray](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ray-brunswick)

Cass and I went to meet Jess at Ray after her show at the [Melbourne Writers Festival][] and found Tara and Johnny there.
Ray can feel like a share house.

[Melbourne Writers Festival]: http://worksbyjparker.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/melbourne-writers-festival-last-weekend.html

Like the best share houses it had good coffee and Tương Ớt Sriracha, which I had on scrambled eggs.
Beside us was a Metallica pinball machine and a large coffee siphon resembling an hourglass.

Ray opened back when I was drinking Gloria Jean's and lead to St Ali, Brother Baba Budan, De Clieu and Seven Seeds.
I can't imagine growing up without Metallica or Melbourne without these cafes.

## [Saint & Rogue](http://www.yelp.com/biz/saint-and-rogue-melbourne)

I used to find people who drank here insufferable but lately it has been feeling more genuine.
When I mentioned this to Tom he pointed out that maybe it was me that had changed.
Maybe.

They had good beer on tap, a mix of Australian craft and European classics like Staropramen.
I drank a Tooborac Maple Cream Ale which I quite liked and a Nail Ale.

## [Dead Man Espresso](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dead-man-espresso-south-melbourne)

We stopped at Dead Man Espresso on our way to South Melbourne Market.
I liked their airy design of wooden slats and ramps and as always a puppy was drinking beside the parked bikes.

The green vegie pancakes and the potato and kale hash both sounded great but came with salmon or kaiserfleisch and no substitutions.
Instead I had eggs on toast with avocado.

I used to love this cafe, their breakfasts, scones and filter coffee, but this time it felt absent.

## [South Melbourne Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-melbourne-market-south-melbourne)

We went to South Melbourne Market for the first Melbourne Tea Fair.
Cass's colleague Charity was there launching [Terroir Tea][] with tea from Taiwan.
A trail of 13 exhibitors was set up throughout the regular market.

The Little Wine Shop had buckets of European beer available like Spaten and Laško.
Killer Sprocket had a stand in front of [Swords Select] and I enjoyed their peated-malt Bandit.

## [Prince Wine Store](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prince-wine-store-south-melbourne)

This was much larger than my local regular Prince Wine Store in Essendon.
They had a great range of wines and I liked their descriptive labels.
They also had several fridges of craft beer and, unlike Essendon, they stocked six-packs.

With its clean lines, downlighting and the glass pod in the back the overall vibe reminded me of the TV series Hannibal.
Yum.

They also own the very nice wine bar Bellota next door.

## [Mankoushé](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mankoush%C3%A9-brunswick-east-3)

For Father's Day we went with Cass's family to Mankoushé's Persian feast.
They had filled several tables with a variety of Iranian dishes that I had never tasted before like kuku sabzi, baghali polow and a stew with okra.
Most were vegan or vegetarian.

They brought us mixed plates so we got to try it all.
Hopefully these events will be held monthly.

## [East Elevation](http://www.yelp.com/biz/east-elevation-brunswick-east)

After Mankoushé we went to East Elevation for dessert.
I had an iced chocolate made with ice cream and topped with cocoa powder.
I also tasted one of several single-origin dark hot chocolates.

Their chocolate was roasted and conched on site.
We bought some chocolate bars from their Bean-to-Bar range.
These fun little experiments showed how changing a variable such as roasting level or conching time affects the result.

## [School of Life](http://www.yelp.com/biz/school-of-life-melbourne)

Jon and I were curious about the School of Life having both been interested in the work of Alain de Botton and also wanting a coffee.
I found it was a nicely designed cafe with above-average magazines (remember magazines?).
They made a decent black coffee using Allpress beans.

Several of their programs looked interesting to me such as exercising philosophy and David Ritter on being free.

## [Goz City](http://www.yelp.com/biz/goz-city-melbourne)

After starting work with Lumo Energy my first lunch out was at Göz City.
I had a mushroom & vegetable gözleme which came with mint yoghurt.
It was light and nicely smoky from the griddle.

## [Valley Cellar Door](http://www.yelp.com/biz/valley-cellardoor-moonee-ponds)

We celebrated my mum's last day with Lend Lease at Valley Cellar Door.
I wish more bottle shops were like it.

They had over two hundred wines.
Each bottle listed both a "take me away" price and a "drink me here" price which was only $8 more.
They also had several fridges of craft beer.

By the glass there was six reds, six whites, a few sparkling, a rose and several taps of craft beer.

Cass and I shared a vegetarian pizza and Mum had a gluten-free one that was surprisingly good.
You could also BYO food.
As dietary requirements and preferences grow increasingly specific this may soon be the only way to eat out.

## [Batch Espresso](http://www.yelp.com/biz/batch-espresso-balaclava)

Jake's bucks party began with breakfast at Batch Espresso at 8:30 AM.
Rod had chosen it based on reviews of their Bloody Marys.
They were rich and spicy and made with 42 Below vodka.

They made a nice black coffee too using Coffee Supreme beans.

Rounding off this complete breakfast of vodka and coffee was their haloumi burger which was grilled and came with coleslaw and pickle relish.

## [Bounce Inc](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bounce-inc-glen-iris)

The next buck's stop was at Bounce Inc.
Jake's oufit of a Vote Abbott T-shirt, tutu and fairy wings was a hit with the kids.
We each got one-hour passes and grip socks then began on the slackline.
None of us could get beyond two metres but it was fun trying and falling.

The free-jumping arena was next.
This was a space covered in trampolines where we bounced, flipped and struggled to run.
Then we played Dodgeball with ten-year-olds and lost.

My favourite was the big bag.
It's a trampoline leading up to a big air-filled bag.
I could have flipped onto that bag all day.

I couldn't shake the feeling that the slam dunk would end in my face hitting the rim but I scored a few anyway.
I enjoyed taking a few steps up the wall too. 

## [City Wine Shop](http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-wine-shop-melbourne)

Rather than spend an entire day with men I had dinner with Mark and Amy at City Wine Shop.
We went mainly because of their wine.

Their menu was written on the wall in chalk but I couldn't recall it ever changing.
I again had their pan-fried gnocchi.
I found it lovely but would have liked some vegetarian variety.

Their wine was fantastic though.
We drank French, Argentinian and Australian by the glass from a short and smart list.
They also had a wide range of bottles available for drink-in or take-away.

## [Fad Gallery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/fad-gallery-melbourne)

After City Wine Shop I went back to find the party.
I phoned Keith who said "we're at a gallery".
In Chinatown at 10 PM?
Luckily Yelp knew he was talking about Fad.

The music was proudly 90s and the mood was upbeat.
It felt appropriate to drink VB by the can.

There's also a gallery upstairs.
There were only a few pieces showing but I found what was there intriguing.
It was a fun place to wander around unsupervised.

## [Aviary Hotel](http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-yelps-old-school-sunday-session-abbotsford)

Cass and I took Henry to his first Yelp Elite event.
It was upstairs at the [Aviary Hotel][].
There were classic games like Jenga and Uno along with Yelp playing cards which we used to play Go Fish.

[Aviary Hotel]: http://www.yelp.com/biz/aviary-hotel-abbotsford

We started with my favourite food pairing: sparkling and potatoes.
The sparkling was a blanc de blancs from Paul Lewis and the potatoes were fried sweet potato, jalapeño and cheese poppers.

Following was a West Winds gin and tonic then a Doña Maria, a sweet and lively cocktail of Tromba tequila, apple liqueur, peach schnapps, lime and cranberry juice which they sell by the jug.
We drank these by the window amidst the occasional crash of Jenga blocks.

## [Belgian Beer Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/belgian-beer-café-southbank-3)

Cass and I celebrated Zwanze Day at the Belgian Beer Cafe with [Matt][] and Andrew.
Brasserie Cantillon launched their first Zwanze Day keg of 2014 here before 55 other locations soon after.

[Matt]: https://untappd.com/user/raktor

We started with Cantillon's Kriek and Iris Grand Cru sour lambics.
Under the outdoor heaters they lit up like traffic lights.

The Zwanze keg of Cuvée Florian was tapped and we waited to collect our 150 mL pours with numbers in our hands like at a deli.
It was the first beer I'd bought days in advance.

My favourite beer of the night was Rodenbach Grand Cru.

## [Two Row](http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-row-fitzroy)

Two Row looked like a cafe but with long craft beer names where the specials board would be.
Their music varied, peaking for me with the House of the Rising Sun.

I was impressed with their taps and bottles.
I drank a Trois Mousquetaires Hopfenweisse from Canada then a Nomad Long Trip Saison from New South Wales.

Cass and I ate the Big Cheese: garlic-buttered sourdough filled with three cheeses and toasted.
I skipped the Dan because it had ham in it and this Dan chooses not to.

After these we went back for another round and their garlic cheesy toast.
This was more of the garlic-buttered sourdough but in snackable form, kind of like chips.

## [Penny Blue](http://www.yelp.com/biz/penny-blue-melbourne)

I had to explain to my English friend Jon that he hadn't been ripped off, that $26 was actually the price of a 500 mL beer.
Admittedly it was a damn fine one but it did lower the mood.

We shared pairs of longnecks between three of us.
My favourite was Liberty Yakima Monster which we followed with Epic Hop Zombie and 8 Wired Tall Poppy, all from New Zealand.
