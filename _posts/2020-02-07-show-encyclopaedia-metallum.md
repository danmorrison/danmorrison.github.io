[This shortcut][] shows a song or album in [Encyclopaedia Metallum][]. It searches for input iTunes media or the song that is currently playing in the Music app.

[Encyclopaedia Metallum]: https://www.metal-archives.com

Before I made this shortcut, several times each day I would memorise a song or album name, open Safari, open the website, type the name into the tiny input field, get annoyed that [spellcheck][] isn't overridden, then eventually get to the page that I wanted.
This is so much nicer.
