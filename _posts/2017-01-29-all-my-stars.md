[Joanne McNeil][]:

> Some performers have a mysterious and magical charisma that no English word quite comes close to capturing.
> In a sentence, it is the quality of a beautiful person who hasn’t revealed all their cards.
> The commotion of beauty and mystery.
> “Intriguing” is too distant.
> “Stunning” is too much of an emphasis on looks, but this quality is atmospheric.
> I suppose the closest word to what I mean is “sexy,” but that’s a bit teenage, certainly people who have it, are the ones to crush over, but some of us prefer wallflowers.
> And this quality isn’t star quality, another superpower charisma: Tom Hardy has it in spades, but Bradley Cooper doesn’t have it, but he's got more than enough of the later.
> It is eerie when an entire cast has it.
> The cast of Moonlight has it.
> The cast of Halt and Catch Fire has it.
