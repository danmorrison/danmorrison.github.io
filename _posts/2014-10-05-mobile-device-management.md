*Bring Your Own Device* is a trend where employees would rather allow corporate security to intrude upon their personal iPhones and iPads than use the commodity devices that their companies would otherwise provide.
Apple supports this on iOS with Mobile Device Management, a solution that respects users.

I installed PwC's Mobile Device Management configuration profile on my iPhone. It contained the following options:

- Mobile Device Management
- Exchange Account
- 2 Restrictions
    - Encrypted backups enforced
    - Documents in the Cloud not allowed
- Password Policy
- 2 Web Clips
- Device Identity Certificate
- 3 Certificates

I appreciated iOS telling me everything that I had opted into.
I found one of these to be untenable though: *Documents in the Cloud not allowed*.
This option prohibits Documents in the Cloud, iCloud Drive and iCloud Photo Library.

This option exists because companies wish to prevent their sensitive data from being shared.
Their wish is unfulfilled though, as sharing with other services remains unrestricted.
Rather than using iCloud employees are able to use other services that I trust less such as Dropbox.

Most importantly, this option intruded upon my personal life.
I choose to entrust iCloud with storing and securing data that I value dearly.
PwC's configuration profile did not trust me so I chose to remove it.

Removing the profile from my iPhone was as easy as [Apple claims][], taking mere seconds.
Once complete I could no longer send and receive PwC mail from my iPhone but I regained full control of my data.

Mobile access to mail enabled me to be more productive.
I don't believe productivity is worth surrendering personal freedom.
