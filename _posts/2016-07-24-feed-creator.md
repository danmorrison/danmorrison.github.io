I love web feeds.
I've had [Reeder][] in my iPhone's dock since April 2011 and it's one of the apps I use most.

If a website doesn't offer a feed then it's unlikely I'll visit it twice.
If I really want to visit it again though I'll create a web feed for it.

The nicest tool I've seen for this is [Feed Creator][].

Thanks [Henry][]!
