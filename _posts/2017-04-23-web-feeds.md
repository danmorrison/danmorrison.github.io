[Zadie Smith][]:

> There is something very important the digital era has to teach young creatives: un-sentimentality.
> A passion for the new.
> Technology is fundamentally un-nostalgic and people who want to be creative would do well to cultivate that instinct.
> Fighting nostalgia, as an artist, can be a full-time job.
